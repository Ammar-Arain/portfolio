        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <h3>I have compiled a few of my projects that I enjoyed working on the most.
            There are some pictures and videos along with them demonstrating how they
            work. </h3>
        <h2> Wireless Serial Port Communication</h2>

        <p> I designed this remote to be able to control a python program I made, 
            as well as output PWM on the receiver. The joysticks were taken out 
            from an old remote and soldered onto the breadboard along with all 
            the other electronics. Both the receiver and the remote are powered 
            through USB-C. </p>
        <p> The wireless communication is done through a NRF24L01 module, programmed 
            using STM32 Blue Pill. The remote collects analog voltage inputs from the 
            joysticks and sends RF signals to the receiver. The receiver interprets 
            these signals and outputs 3 PWM pins. The data is also sent from the receiver 
            to a python program through a serial port. The python program is very simple 
            and only to demonstrate the wireless communication between the remote and the 
            receiver. Depending on the positions of the joysticks on the remote, the plane 
            in the python program moves faster/slower and up/down.</p>
        

        
        <h2 style = "padding-top: 100px;"> Metal Detecting RC Robot</h2>
        <p> In a group of 6, we designed and built a metal detecting remote controlled robot. 
            The robot had the functionality of being controlled from the remote, detecting 
            metal, sending the metal strength back to the remote and picking up metal with an 
            electromagnet. The remote had a joy stick to control the movements of the robot 
            and a LCD to display the metal strength.</p>
        <p> I mostly focused on assembling the robot, making the circuits and programming the 
            communication between the robot and the remote. For the communication we used a 
            pair of JDY-40 radio transceiver. The microcontroller on the remote was ATMega 328p, 
            on the robot was EFM8. Both were programmed using the programming language C. I also 
            designed and built the mechanism the pick up the metal on the robot. </p>
 
        
        <h2> Reflow Oven Controller</h2>
        <p>In a group of 6, we designed and built a reflow oven controller which was used to control 
            the oven so we could solder surface mount components. The controller had an option to 
            change the amount of time a state was on for and the temperature it was at. This was done 
            with a K-type thermocouple wire which was used to detect the temperature and send the 
            values to the N76E003 microcontroller to be processed. The microcontroller which was 
            programmed in assembly outputted PWM to control the oven. The temperature was also 
            plotted on a graph which indicated the moment the state had changed. The graph part 
            of the project was programmed in Python. </p>
        <p> I mainly focused on designing and building the circuit along with programming different 
            states of the finite state machine. The main tasks of the software controller was to read 
            temperatures between 25C to 240C and display them on the LCD, control the power of the oven 
            by generating PWM signals, allow button input to change soak and reflow times/temperatures, 
            allow buttons to start, stop, and reset the reflow process and send temperatures via SPI to 
            be displayed on the temperature strip chart.</p>
        
        <h2> Line Following Robot</h2>
        <p> In a group of 3, we programmed a line following robot using a PIC18F46K42 microcontroller. 
            Our task was to program multiple functions which allowed the robot to get passed different 
            obstacles, such as distractions on the track, make sharp left/right turns, come back around 
            if the track ended and stop on the landing pad. This was all programmed using the programming 
            language C.</p>
        <p> Through collaboration and the use of debugging, we overcame many challenges. The robot used 
            infrared sensors to detect the track. We had to do many tests in order to get the correct 
            threshold values for the sensors so the robot could run smooth. </p>
        
        <h2> RC Plane</h2>
        <p> I built a remote controlled plane twice, the first time I built one alone and the second time 
            in a group of 4 people. Since I had already built one before, the second time I taught my group 
            members how the plane worked and how to build it, from the electrical hardware to the body of 
            the plane. </p>
        <p> I constructed the RC plane using foam board, wood, and fiberglass for strength to weight 
            optimization. The motor mount was made from wood through the use of hand tools. During this 
            project, I learnt how to wire and attach brushless motors with electric speed controllers 
            and how they all worked together. The plane had a brushless motor with a tested maximum thrust 
            of 1kg. Directions of the plane were controlled by using servos attached to control surfaces of 
            the plane. The motor and the servos were controlled by using a 2.4GHz receiver which received 
            signals from the remote transmitter. The plane weighed 450g and had an estimated flight time 
            of 45 minutes. </p>
