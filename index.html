        <p>I am an Electrical Engineering student 
            at the University of British Columbia 
            with an interest in engineering solutions 
            to real-world challenges.</p>

        <p>I love taking apart and fixing old electronic 
            devices in order to learn how they work. I spend 
            a lot of my time working on different projects 
            and spending time in Sailbots, a design team 
            which specializes in making fully autonomous 
            sailboats to gather oceanic data. I mainly focus 
            on prototyping and designing electrical hardware 
            to control the boat's direction.</p> 

        <p>I have put some of my projects that I enjoyed the most 
            working on here. If you have any questions, feel free 
            to contact me! </p>
